## Challenges and Solutions

During the environment setup, I had a problem with the directory of the folder. It returns "The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect." so the solution I did was open the file explorer from there I get the actual directory, paste it in cmd and it works.

## Learning Outcomes
Althought, this is not my first time in doing it, but still I forgot it. From this task I have refreshed my knowledge and also I have learned something new.
